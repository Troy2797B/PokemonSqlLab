How many pokemon at level 100 does each trainer with at least one level 100 pokemon have?

(Hint: your query should not display a trainer)
//how many trainers have a pokemon over level 100?
SELECT COUNT(pokelevel > 100)
FROM pokemon_trainer
JOIN trainers
WHERE pokelevel > 100;
//how many pokemon does each have over level 100


==========
What are all the primary types and how many pokemon have that type?

SELECT x.id, x.name, COUNT(X.name)
FROM types AS X
JOIN pokemons AS Y
ON X.id = Y.primary_type
GROUP BY x.id;
